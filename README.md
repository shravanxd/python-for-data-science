# Python for Data Science Course

I designed this course to help anyone go from zero to one — and eventually to one hundred — in Python for Data Science. The course is highly practical, filled with real-world examples, datasets, and case studies to help you break into roles in Data Science, Analytics, or AI. 

Whether you're just starting out or brushing up before interviews, this course provides hands-on exercises and mini-projects at every step. I update the notebook every week with fresh content and concepts.
